# language-translator 👨‍💻
A Python GUI that translates 20 words between English and another language

Made using Python's tkinter

#### To-Do:
* Merge frames to one (get input, display buttons, and display output in one frame)
    * For now, input is in a separate window from displaying outputs and buttons 
* Use a better way to access the database of words
* Efficiently update database of words
* Make GUI look cleaner and presentable
* When adding a word, it should open a input text boxes in the same GUI (maybe...?)


####Branches
 * Mat doing the GUI cleanup and merges
 * Zulfa doing the database and the niceness of the GUI because she's lazy :D
